You have had some time to access some of the VMs in the cluster and also the repository in our GHE.
Compare
1. the Ansible playbook ESTL uses to spin up the Infra to your Ansible playbook
2. ESTL's logging and monitoring framework to yours

Use the following guiding questions, take another look at the ESTL setup and repo again, and I would like each of you to share what you have gathered.
- what are some differences that stand out,
- are there any parts/components in the ESTL setup that has left you scratching your head; and
- are there any parts of the ESTL setup in which you might have a different approach?

Take your time, dig deep and post your response by 4 Sept 2019.
